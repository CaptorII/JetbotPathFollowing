    "# Assessment 2: NVIDIA Jetbot Path Following and Pest Detection\n",
    "### Objective: \n",
    "The objective of this assessment is to evaluate the students' ability to apply and enhance AI models for real-world applications using the NVIDIA Jetbot platform.\n",
    "### Training the Jetbot:\n",
    "You are required to use the NVIDIA Jetbot to train it to follow a predefined path within a specified environment, in this case the classroom following the pink tape.\n",
    "You must document the entire training process, including code, model selection, and training parameters, in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook should include comments explaining the rationale behind their choices and any issues they encountered."

    "Using the model you have created in Assessment 1 (or a similar one), you must implement inference to detect pests.\n",
    "You need to demonstrate how the Jetbot can identify and respond to pests in real-time during its path following.\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook should contain code for inference and comments explaining the model's performance."
